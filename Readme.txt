The game consists of a human player and the computer. Both choose either the value 0 or the value 1. If both choose the same numbers, the computer earns a point. If the numbers chosen are different, the human player earns a point. This is repeated n times. The winner is the one who accumulates more points at the end of n moves. The strategy to be implemented for the computer to "predict" the human player's bid is based on a simple "machine learning" algorithm.
